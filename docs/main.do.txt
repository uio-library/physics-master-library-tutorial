===== Exercise: Literature search =====
*Spend 15 minutes on this exercise working with your group*

As a group, choose a topic for a literature search. You may come up with your own, or use one of the examples below. 
It is an advantage if someone on the group knows something about the topic. 

* High $T_c$ superconductor materials of type 2
* Crystallization pressure of hydration of periclase
* Energy barriers of crystal growth
* How does LIGO work?
* How old is the universe? Exactly

Agree on a search string (words to put into the search engine). Find scientific papers about your topic using "Scopus": "https://www.scopus.com" *or* "WebOfScience": "https://www.webofscience.com" *and* "Google Scholar": "https://scholar.google.com". How many papers do you find using each search engine?  
!esubex


!bsubex
Refine your search using the the refinement tools on both search engines. Can you narrow down to manageable number of papers? 
If yes: good. If no: try to make your search terms more specific. 
!esubex

!bsubex
The next steps would be to read through all the titles of your search results after narrowing down, and then read all the abstracts of the papers with compelling titles. To save time, we are skipping this today.

===== Exercise: Citations and references =====
*Spend 20 minutes on this exercise working with your group*

Even though we expect that you have learned about citatons and referencing before, we take some time to refresh it now. 

Using citations and references correctly ensures that 

    o the reader knows where to read more about something
    o the reader can check your facts and verify your results  
    o that you credit the right person for a discovery, claim, line of reasoning etc. rather than pretending you made it up yourself. 

(1) and (2) makes what you write easier to follow, and shows where it fits into the literature. (3) ensures you avoid plagiarism. 

To be sure that we agree on the terminology, we have included two figures showing what are *citations* and what are *references*. 

FIGURE: [figures/citations.png, width=400] These are citations (inside green cirlcles.)

FIGURE: [figures/references.png, width=400] ... and these are the references. The references contain enough information to find the document that was cited.

In the examples below, we have taken small sections of text from real academic papers. We have highlighted *one* of the citations in each section of text. In the exercises below, discuss with your group the reason for having the citation, and then check the answer. 

## Factual statement 
!bquestion
We have highlighted one of the citations in the text below with boldface. Why is that citation needed? 
!bquiz
Q: [] 

Standard force fields, designed to be numerically efficient, are created by fitting a subset of thermodynamic and structural properties to an analytic expression for the potential energy, typically consisting of sums of pairwise long-range terms <b>[8]</b>. In many systems, this approach has proved successful even if the accuracy of such force fields is at best around 1 kcal/mol. For example, Schames et al. [9] used molecular dynamics simulations to discover a hidden binding site in HIV integrase, a molecule that enables the integration of HIV’s genetic material into the host cell DNA. This discovery led to experimental confirmation [10] and subsequent development of raltegravir, a successful medicine that halts the progression of HIV into AIDS. Another success was the simultaneous discovery by simulation [11] and experiment [12] of the molecular basis of mutations in a gene responsible for Gaucher’s disease, a genetic disease causing the build-up of fatty substances in the organism.

## Parafrase 
!bquestion
Why the citatiton(s) in the text below?
!bquiz
Q: []
Here we present our recent development of a class of force fields for materials modelling <b>[14–20]</b> that are transferable,
physically motivated, and implemented in the general purpose molecular dynamics software QDO_MD. The technique treats many-body polarisation and many-body dispersion on the same footing by representing electronic distributions of individual atoms and molecular moieties using a single coarse grained particle.

Cw: [] Factual statement from a different paper. 

Cw: [] Reading guide.

Cr: [] Alert of paraphrase. 
E: This is a review paper where the authors are summing up their efforts over some time. Thus to avoid muddling up the paper with a lot of citations, they just state that the contents are taken from other papers. This would usually not be accepted in original research papers.

Cw: [] Non-standard equation
Cw: [] Statement originally made in cited paper
Cr: [] To avoid copyright infringements 
E: This may be true, but another alternative is also true. 
Cr: [] To refer to the paper originally containing the figure. 
E: This is the main reason for this citation. Depending on the publisher, it may also be required to cite in order to comply with the conditions for reuse.

Where in this text would you add citations? 
!bquiz
Q: [] Singular or nonrough surfaces, which correspond to cusps in the plot of the surface free energy as a function of orientation, advance and retreat via the lateral motion of steps that add or subtract atomic layers. If a singular surface has no steps or step sources, its motion is limited by two-dimensional nucleation. The so-called “growth resistance” that is derived from the two- dimensional nucleation barrier was a controversial topic in the first half of the twentieth century, as researchers attempted to under- stand how singular surfaces could advance at supersaturations 10–100 times smaller than those predicted by nucleation theory. This issue was settled by Frank, who convincingly argued that screw-dislocation/surface intersections provide the source of the steps necessary for a singular facet to advance or retreat under the low-supersaturation conditions that are observed in growth exper- iments. In this communication, a singular surface (or facet) without steps is termed an ideal singular surface. When the problem of two-dimensional nucleation on an ideal singular facet was revisited by Hirth, using a refined theory, the conclusions of the earlier investigations were substantiated.

Below is a text excerpt from a scientific paper [P.W. Anderson. 1972. More is Different. <i>Science</i> 177, 4042]. Do you consider the citations to be sufficient? Discuss with your group. 

!bquiz
Q: [] The reductionist hypothesis may still be a topic for contrtoversy among philosphers, but among the great majority of active scientists I think it is accepted without question. The workings of our minds and bodies, and of all the animate or inanimate matter of which we have any detailed knowledge, are assumed to be controlled by the same set of fundamental laws, which except under certain extreme conditions we feel we know pretty well. 

It seems inevitable to go on uncritically to what appears at first sight to be an obvious corollary of reductionism: that if everything obeys the same fundamental laws, then the only scientists who are studying anything really fundamental are those who are working on those laws. In practice, that amounts to some astrophysicists, some elementary particle physicists, some logicians and other matematicians, and few others. This point of view, which it is the main purpose of this article to oppose, is expressed in a rather well-known passage by Weisskopf [1]:

...


Cr: [] Yes
E: Perhaps. Depending on the readership that is being addressed, this amount of citations may or may be sufficient. 
Cr: [] No
E: Perhaps. Depending on the readership that is being addressed, this amount of citations may or may be sufficient.

===== Exercise: Copyright =====
*Spend 10 minutes working through this exercise with your group*

When you are writing your thesis, you may want to reuse materials found in books, papers etc. In addition to referring correctly to these, you may need to obtain permissions to avoid copyright infringements. 

In general, you always need to obtain copyright in order to use materials that other people made. But there are a myriad of exceptions. Perhaps the most important one: There is no copyright on facts. Thus stating a fact that someone else discovered or came up with is fine. 

Another exception is that figures *only* showing data don't need permissions. This for instance applies to most simple plots. But note that as soon as the author has drawn something om top of the plot, it may be subject to copyright. 

Additionally, more and more journals are using "Creative Commons": "https://creativecommons.org/" licences on their articles, which gives you the right to reuse the contents under specific conditions. For the the rest, you need to explicitly get permission for use, but this is usually quite simple (and automated). See for instance the example below from *Physical Review Letters*.

=== Overview of breaking the rules ===
The difference between plagiarism and copyright infringements. Note that some actions may fall into both categories simultaneously. 
|--c---------c----|
| Plagiarism | Copyright infringement|
|--------c---------c---------|
| Giving the impression that someone else’s work is your own. | Using someone else’s work without their permission.|
| Reasonably easy to avoid by being honest. | Difficult/vague rules. Fair use etc. | 
| An ethical construct | A legal construct |
| May get you expelled | May lead to claims for damages |

===== Exercise: Bonus exercise -- using a reference manager with latex =====
*Only do this exercise if you are not familiar with using a reference manager with latex. Do this exercise individually, but ask your peers (or a teacher) for help if you need to. If you didn't bring your laptop, you may either try to use a service such as overleaf, or do this exercise some other time.*

There are two absolute requirements on references:

o Enough information to find the document being referred to
o Consistent styling 

Keeping track of your references is simpler with a reference management software. Mendeley, Zotero and EndNote are commonly used. All of them support bibtex export (for latex) and have plugins for use with Microsoft Word. These programs both act as a library keeping track of all the documents you have added there, and they help you creating flawless reference lists. 

!bsubex
Install a reference manager (e.g. Mendeley or Zotero). Toss a coin if you don't know which to choose. 
!esubex

!bsubex
Drop a couple of article pdfs into your reference manager. Export biblatex citations to a .bib file. 
!esubex

!bsubex
The following is a minimal example of a latex document using biblatex. 

!bc
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

\usepackage[style=nature, backend=biber]{biblatex}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} 
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\addbibresource{bibliography.bib}

\begin{document}

This is a citation \cite{some_author2019}. 

\printbibliography

\end{document}
!ec

Use this example with your exported .bib file to create a nicely formatted reference list.
